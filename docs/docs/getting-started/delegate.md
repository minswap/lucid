## Register stake key

`2 ADA` will be taken as pledge for the registration of the stake key.

```js
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet.rewardAddress();

const tx = await lucid.newTx()
  .registerStake(rewardAddress)
  .commit();

const signedTx = await tx.sign().commit();

const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```

## Delegate to a stake pool

```js
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet.rewardAddress();

const tx = await lucid.newTx()
  .delegateTo(rewardAddress, "poolabc...")
  .commit();

const signedTx = await tx.sign().commit();

const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```

## Withdraw rewards

```js
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet.rewardAddress();

const delegation = await lucid.wallet.getDelegation();

const tx = await lucid.newTx()
  .withdraw(rewardAddress, delegation.rewards)
  .commit();

const signedTx = await tx.sign().commit();

const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```

## Deregister stake key

Reclaim the `2 ADA` used for the registration of the stake key.

```js
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet.rewardAddress();

const tx = await lucid.newTx()
  .deregisterStake(rewardAddress)
  .commit();

const signedTx = await tx.sign().commit();

const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```
